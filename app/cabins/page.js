/* Note! in Suspense
  A navigation(just we did in Filter component by getting a new URL) in Next.js is always wrapped in a React transition.
  And in a transition, the suspense will not hide the content that has already been rendered earlier.
  So that's just the default behavior of suspense. So, Next.js automatically wraps this page with transition.
  we can actually fix this by passing in a unique key.
